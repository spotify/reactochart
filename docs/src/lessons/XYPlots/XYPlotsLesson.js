          Nearly all of the chart components included in Reactochart (except
          PieChart and TreeMap) are cartesian or "X/Y"-type charts. They accept
          an array of <code>data</code> and represent these data with some form
          of SVG marks on a 2-dimensional X/Y coordinate plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          These chart components are not meant to be rendered on their own, but
          should instead always be wrapped in a
          <code>
            {'<'}XYPlot{'>'}
          </code>{' '}
          component. <code>XYPlot</code> is a wrapper which iterates over all of
          its charts and generates a common set of X and Y{' '}
          <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale">scales</a>, which are shared
          and provided to its children as <code>scale</code> props.{' '}
          <code>XYPlot</code> also accepts several other props which apply to
          all of its children, such as <code>width</code> and{' '}
          <code>height</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's an example of basic <code>XYPlot</code> to render a{' '}
          <code>LineChart</code>:
        </p>
        <ExampleSection
          id="basic"
          label="XYPlot and LineChart"
          codeText={require('./examples/LineChart.js.example').default}
        />

        <p>
          Generally, you will want to render a <code>XAxis</code> and a{' '}
          <code>YAxis</code> component along with your chart. These components
          render titles, labels, ticks and grid lines to denote your X and Y
          axes. One advantage of using a common <code>XYPlot</code> wrapper is
          that it ensures the axis labels are using the same scales as the
          charts themselves, and are therefore correctly labeling them.{' '}
          <code>XAxis</code> and <code>YAxis</code> accept several props to
          control how they are displayed; see their docs for more information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the axes will take up some space in the margin around the
          chart. The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> props provided
          to <code>XYPlot</code> control the <strong>outer</strong> width of the
          chart, including the margin and the axes inside them. The inner size
          of the chart plot itself is determined by <code>XYPlot</code> and
          passed down to children charts as (smaller) <code>width</code> and{' '}
          <code>height</code> props.
        </p>
        <ExampleSection
          id="lineChartWithAxis"
          label="LineChart with axes"
          codeText={require('./examples/LineChartWithAxis.js.example').default}
        />

        <p>
          Another advantage of <code>XYPlot</code> is that it provides a common
          container for rendering multiple charts together on the same axes.
          These can be charts of the same type (ie. multiple{' '}
          <code>LineCharts</code>), and/or multiple kinds of charts. Any of the
          XY-type charts in Reactochart can be rendered alongside one another
          inside <code>XYPlot</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that these charts render SVG elements, which do not respect{' '}
          <code>z-index</code>; instead their Z-order is determined by the order
          in which they are drawn. So if you want to draw a{' '}
          <code>BarChart</code> underneath a <code>LineChart</code>, put it
          before the <code>LineChart</code> inside <code>XYPlot</code>.
        </p>

          id="multiChart"
          label="Multiple Charts in one XYPlot"
          codeText={require('./examples/MultiChart.js.example').default}
        />
